Description: 
  
  A mobile place where you or I can clone to practice data structures
  and help out with general intuition on interview questions as
  I think of them and/or as you think of them, or from my university 
  handbook. You can download this and make functions for the comments 
  I have in there. I did a couple as examples. Do all of em to be 
  slightly better at data structures. 
  
  Make sure you do it all using recursion (yes, even circular linked 
  lists, it's like so fun) and don't add any attributes to nodes. To make it 
  work, extra functions can be added (I'll show what that looks like in the 
  example) and use pointer arithmetic to traverse arrays, rather than direct 
  access (also just for more fun and intuition).
  
  If you want to add questions, just comment them into a scratch copy like the
  one here and I'll add u to contributors n authors... You know, so your name is 
  online more.
  
  ***don't forget to compile with the .o file***
  
  Anyway, have fun boo.
